# TARDIS: Embark on your Chad Journey through time

This is a fictional TARDIS console interface. The TARDIS is a time-traveling spacecraft from the popular TV series Doctor Who.

The website consists of two main sections: the login section and the console section. Initially, only the login section is visible. Once the user submits a valid username and password, the console section becomes visible. Some features have not been completed check console after clicking any non-working button after logging in.

Within the console section, there are several elements and features:

1) Dashboard: Displays the current location and time of the TARDIS.
2) Controls: Provides buttons to perform actions such as materializing, dematerializing, activating the time rotor, and engaging the chameleon circuit.

5) Emergency Protocols: Contains a button to activate emergency protocols.
6) Travel Log and Journal: Enables the user to write journal entries and displays a list of previous entries.

I apologise if you find the "Emergency Protocol" misleading but it will be fun!
